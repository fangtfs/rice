* About
This my Emacs + Nix configuration.  I purposely put them together for my own convenience.

Before proceeding, be aware of that this is highly customized and it may NOT work for you.

* Get started
Use as an Emacs configuration.

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/peromage/rice.git ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

Use as a Nix flake.

#+begin_src bash
nix flake show ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

Generate a flake template.

#+begin_src bash
nix flake init -t "github:peromage/rice/master#"
#+end_src

Quickly deploy dotfiles.

#+begin_src bash
# Single
stow.sh -s <name>

# Multiple
stow.sh -s <name1> <name2> <name3>
#+end_src

* Project Overview
The tracked directories are intentionally surrounded by underscores since there are many local files/directories generated as use the configurations.

- [[./__pew__][pew]]: Emacs configuration.
- [[./__pix__][pix]]: NixOS configuration.
- [[__pot__][pot]]: Daily driver configurations.
