* About
This is my Emacs + Nix + dotfile configuration.

I intentionally organize the files in such ways merely for my own convenience (The project root is used as both Emacs config and Nix flake).

Before proceeding, be aware of that this is highly customized and it may NOT work for you.

* Get started
Use as an Emacs configuration.

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/peromage/rice.git ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

Use as a Nix flake.

#+begin_src bash
nix flake show .
#+end_src

Generate a flake template.

#+begin_src bash
nix flake init -t "github:peromage/rice/master#"
#+end_src

Quickly deploy dotfiles via GNU Stow.

#+begin_src bash
__pot__/stow.sh -s NAME [NAME [NAME [...]]]
#+end_src

* Project Overview
The tracked directories are surrounded by underscores since there are many local files/directories generated in the use of the configurations.

- [[./__pew__][pew]]: Emacs configuration.
- [[./__pix__][pix]]: NixOS configuration.
- [[__pot__][pot]]: Daily driver configurations.
