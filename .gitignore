## Emacs user directory is usually filled with random files. It would be a hassle
## to exclude them all.  Thus whitelist mode is used in this gitignore file.

## First, exclude all files
*

## Include pew files
!/pew/
!/pew/**
## But without compiled ELisp files
/pew/**/*.elc

## Include my rice config
!/rice/
!/rice/**

## Include GitHub workflows
!/.github/
!/.github/**

## Include files at the repo root
!/.gitignore
!/LICENSE
!/README.org
!/early-init.el
!/init.el
!/init-mini.el

## Cached package bundle
!/elpa-*.tar.gz
