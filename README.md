# PEW - Peromage's Emacs Workstation

> Makes your workflow like pewpewpew

This is my personal Emacs configuration. It intends to be as minimal as possible.

## Get Started

Clone this repo and put it to your home directory with folder name `.emacs.d`.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/peromage/pew.git .emacs.d
```

Then Emacs will automatically install everything for you.

## Local Files

Temporary local changes can go into `pew/local.el` including settings by `customize`.

`local.el` will be applied on top of the default pew configuration.

## Directories

- *lisp*: Pew configurations.
- *site-lisp*: Third party packages.
- *snippets*: My snippets.

## TODO

- [ ] DAP mode
- [ ] TRAMP mode
