;;; elpa-eyebrowse.el --- Workspace management -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
;;; Commentary:

;; Like `winner-mode', `eyebrowse-mode' arranges multiple workspaces.
;; This functionality can be replaced with builtin tab which works pretty much the same.

;;; Code:

(use-package eyebrowse
  :commands eyebrowse-mode)

(provide 'elpa-eyebrowse)
;;; elpa-eyebrowse.el ends here
